Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used to implement the Comprehensive Applicant Notification System:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/submit_application', methods=['POST'])
def submit_application():
    # Code to submit the loan application
    # Send notification to the applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application submitted successfully'})

@app.route('/update_status', methods=['POST'])
def update_status():
    # Code to update the application status
    # Send notification to the applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Application status updated successfully'})

@app.route('/send_loan_offer', methods=['POST'])
def send_loan_offer():
    # Code to send the loan offer details
    # Send notification to the applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan offer sent successfully'})

@app.route('/send_disbursement', methods=['POST'])
def send_disbursement():
    # Code to send the disbursement details
    # Send notification to the applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Disbursement details sent successfully'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines four routes: `/submit_application`, `/update_status`, `/send_loan_offer`, and `/send_disbursement`. Each route corresponds to a specific action in the user story.

To implement the complete system, you will need to add the necessary logic to handle the loan application submission, status updates, loan offer sending, and disbursement sending. You will also need to integrate with the loan application system, communication service providers, and data protection tools as mentioned in the user story.

Additionally, you will need to implement the user interface for applicants to select their preferred notification method and handle the delivery of notifications through email, SMS, or push notifications.

Remember to test and verify the functionality of the API endpoints, ensure the notifications are sent in a timely manner, and comply with data protection and privacy regulations.
